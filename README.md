This project is my work on transferring an archaic pen-and-paper document database of Aberystwyth port and ship and mariner data to a computer-based solution using MongoDB. The 5 main code files are get_records.py, individual_stories.py, ship_excel_schema.py, transfer_all_ship_data.py, and who_and_where.py.

who_and_where.py fulfilled the client requirement of analysing ship routes and patterns.
individual_stories.py fulfilled the client requirement of being able to identify, view, and explore promotion tracks of unique individuals. 

The other python files concern importing the data, from csv files, into a MongoDB database in a way in which data integrity was maintained.
